# WeatherPy :globe_with_meridians:

### "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

* Visualization by scatter plots of the weather of 500+ cities across the world randomly selected by coordinates (latitude and longitude) using **citipy**, to showcase the following relationships:

  * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude   :fire:
  * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude   :sweat_drops:
  * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude   :cloud:
  * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude   :dash:

* Considerations:
  * Every time you run the program, the responses will change randomly 
  * Date is retrieved in [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com)

* Tools: 
  * [Citipy Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy)
  * [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
